The axios package is not properly imported at the top of the file.

The app.use(express.json()) middleware is missing, which is required to parse the JSON request body.

The forEach loop is used to make API requests sequentially, which can be slow. It should be replaced with Promise.all to make concurrent requests.

Error handling is missing. If an API request fails or returns an error, it should be handled gracefully.

The code lacks proper validation of the request body. It should check if the developers property exists and is an array.

The GitHub API URL is hardcoded multiple times. It should be extracted into a constant for better maintainability.

The code lacks proper formatting and comments, making it difficult to read and understand.
